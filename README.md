Based on the charts above showing the temperature in June compared to December, there are three key factors to assist in "weather" (pun intended) or not to open the shop:
- It appears there is enough sample data to use given the high counts for each month.
- The variance in average temperature is minimal - only approx 4 degrees.
- The minimum temperature in December is nearly 10 degrees colder than the minimum temperature in June. 


## Summary

The analysis above would support opening the shop as there is little fluctuation in temperature, however given the low temp in December it may be necessary to close up shop on occassion.  Further analysis needs to be complete to fully support opening the shop.

## Further Analysis

The analysis above does not factor in rain, so that analysis should also be completed.  While the temperature may be ideal, if it is raining most days then sales may be negatively impacted.  

Another analysis to complete would be to see how frequently the temp is near the minimum as this would also likely have a negative impact on sales.
